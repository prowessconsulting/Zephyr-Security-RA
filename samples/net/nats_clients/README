NATS Client Library
-------------------

NATS is a text-based IoT protocol based on a publisher-subscriber paradigm.

This implementation is still WORK IN PROGRESS. So, API may change.

NATS messages are listed below:

Msg	Side	Description
INFO	Server	Sent to client after initial TCP/IP connection
CONNECT Client	Sent to server to specify connection information
PUB	Client	Publish a message to a subject, with optional reply subject
SUB	Client	Subscribe to a subject (or subject wildcard)
UNSUB	Client	Unsubscribe (or auto-unsubscribe) from subject
MSG	Server	Delivers a message payload to a subscriber
PING	Both	PING keep-alive message
PONG	Both	PONG keep-alive response
+OK	Server	Acknowledges well-formed protocol message in verbose mode
-ERR	Server	Indicates a protocol error. Will cause client disconnect.


Known Limitations
-----------------

Msg	Side	Status
INFO	Server	Partially implemented. Not fully tested.
INFO	Client	Partially implemented. See nats_unpack_info function.
CONNECT	Client	Fully implemented.
PUB	Client	Fully implemented.
SUB	Client	Fully implemented.
UNSUB	Client	Fully implemented.
MSG	Client	Fully implemented.
PING	Server	Fully implemented.

		from +OK, we must assume an error was detected by the peer.
		Future versions may include this message.
